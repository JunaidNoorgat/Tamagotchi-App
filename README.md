Report on Dog App - In-Depth Analysis

The objective of the application is:

The Dog App aims to offer users a nostalgic virtual experience akin to the well-known 1990s electronic pet toy. With it, they can tend and nourish a digital creature straight from their mobile or other devices. It entails feeding, washing, playing with the animal while keeping tabs on its welfare such as healthiness and hunger levels; sanitation status is also monitored too. The application's objective seeks to amuse clients by mimicking a real companion that instills obligation feelings within them simultaneously creating an illusion of comradeship between user & pet alike

Considerations for Design:

UI: Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The user interface aims to captivate and create a warm atmosphere by using lively hues, playful typography, and attractive visuals for an aesthetically pleasing encounter.

To enhance the interactive experience of the application, distinct actions including feeding, cleaning and playing are communicated through personalized graphics that signify virtual pet's mood.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use, featuring straightforward navigation and readily available action buttons.

Logic for the Screen Display upon First Arrival:

Users are greeted by a warm welcome message and an image of the virtual pet on the welcome screen.

An eye-catching button is available to guide users towards the primary game interface, guaranteeing a smooth entry into the application's experience.

Logic for Second Screen:

On the primary game interface, three action buttons: Feed, Clean and Play are exhibited alongside the depiction of a virtual pet.

Whenever an action button is pressed, the virtual pet's image undergoes a corresponding alteration to mirror the executed activity. This improves user feedback and engrossment.

When an action is carried out, the status variables such as health, hunger and cleanliness are automatically adjusted in real-time at the bottom of the screen. This enables users to receive immediate feedback on their pet's well-being.

3. The use of GitHub and GitHub Actions:

GitHub for Version Control:

The project was given a new GitHub repository, which started with the creation of a README file providing an overview.

The entire collection of project materials, comprising source code, assets and documentation were committed and uploaded onto the GitHub repository.

Committing to the repository regularly ensured efficient tracking of project progress and maintenance of version history.

Automated testing and manual testing:

All app functions, including user interactions and transitions were tested comprehensively to guarantee optimal performance and accurate operation.

Testing the precision of status value updates was prioritized, which were based on user actions such as feeding, cleaning and playing. The simulated decrease over time reflected the pet's requirements and state accurately.

The testing and build processes were automated using GitHub Actions to guarantee the deployability and functionality of the codebase on various environments.

In conclusion,

By providing an engaging user interface, intuitive navigation and seamless integration with GitHub, the Dog app allows users to enjoy a fun and interactive virtual pet caring experience on their mobile devices. With modern development practices used for ensuring reliability and maintainability alongside nostalgic elements in its design, this app offers both high-tech functionality as well as old-school charm.
